Postmortem: Understanding Outages and Ensuring Reliability

Information Accessibility: Post-outage, it provides a detailed summary for all company employees, especially managers and executives, to understand the cause of the outage and its potential impact on operations.

Root Cause Analysis and Prevention: It ensures that the root cause(s) of the outage are identified and that corrective measures are taken to prevent recurrence.
